Heeeey!

How you doin’? I didn’t call you in a while, did I? It’s time for revenge!

Kitchen Rush is dead. Sad but true. Or is it? Yeah, it is. Maybe not sad, but true it is.

But don’t cry. You’re not in private, and it’s a shame to cry in public. Don’t worry, WE are working on FOUR projects at ONCE! How is it possible?

Tomsha (or SetName, forgot how did I called him) is working on some **Dice game**, dunno, but it’s gonna be cool, as I know him. Wait for it!

Bonifac loves cars. And crashing. And crashing cars! But he don’t have a lot of money, so he couldn’t loose any on crashing cars when parking. That’s why he is creating **Parking simulator CART edition** as it’s harder to park with carriage.

Jojoo (the one who only loves money, but don’t know anything) IS lame. As always… He refused to do any programming work, so he’s writing an essay ’bout **ChatGPT &amp; Artificial Intelligence**, cringe.

I’m working on local news website. It’s not fun, as I have to come up with the design. But stay still, we’ll do it!

Take care, and till the next time, have a good one!
