How you doin´ fellas nerds? We just launched the first version of Kitchen Rush! And that´s how the news go!

The greatest thanks belongs to Bonifác, who worked (out) really hard, so you can now **<mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); color: #fffb00;">GET YOUR BALL TO THE GAME &amp; MAKE IT MOVE</mark>**! Absolutely **outstanding performance**, i must say.

The smallest thanks deserves [<mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); color: #ff0707;">Jojoo</mark>](http://jessgames.atwebpages.com/about-us/), who´s still entirely useless, despite his “work” (look, there are quotes – that means i lied, its all humour) he means nothing in terms of… (anything)

Hmmmmm, I didnt do anything to make this happen. Or didnt i? Oh hell i did!  
Thank me for all this – and **CHECK OUT the FIRST VERSION** of [**<mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); color: #00d1e9;">KITCHEN RUSH</mark>**](http://jessgames.atwebpages.com/game/memory-rush/)
