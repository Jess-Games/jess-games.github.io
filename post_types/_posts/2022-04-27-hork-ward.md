Oh yeaaa dogs! We are **<mark class="has-inline-color has-tertiary-color" style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">work</mark>**ing **<mark class="has-inline-color has-tertiary-color" style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">hard</mark>**, we´ll make our ass off for you. As you may know, we release First version of Kitchen Rush. I believe nobody played it yet cause its piece of shit. However, **!play it!**, i guarantee you will love it, you share it with your friend, you adore us, you give us your money, we will have money, we leave you with half complete game. We Bee Happy, You Bee Sad. Emmmmmm, not my problem.

Hitherto, i didnt see any of you on our [discord](https://discord.gg/aJzZvYMPcN), dont wait, or i´ll kill myslef (not really, i will rather kill you, but i am not supposed to tell you). Maybe it is cause there is nobody crowling around (i am glad for this). But I want money, so **I want YOU to PLAY Kitchen Rush** and <mark class="has-inline-color has-background-color" style="background-color: #ffffff;">**give me money**</mark> – our not-transparent bank account will appear soon.

Dont blame me for my english. IRL iam definitly good, but this is my sick language i write with <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); color: #fc0707;">**LOVE** </mark>and <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); color: #120dff;">DESIRE of MONEY</mark>.

Love you
