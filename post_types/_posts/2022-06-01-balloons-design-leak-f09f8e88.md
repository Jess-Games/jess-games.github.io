Heeeey evrybódy!

I just want to share my joy with you 😀 Look at all these balloons! How wonderful they are! And you know what? I can change it to many other falling items! So get ready to some nice bullshit falling down!

On the brighter side, Tomsha, the head of design department, worked his ass off, so the game gonna be nicer. All this for you &amp; for A from IT.

I wanna be Tom Holland, so I leak something. LOOK:

<div class="wp-block-group is-layout-flow"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"><div class="wp-block-columns are-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flex wp-container-2"><div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis: 100%;"><div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-large">![](http://jessgames.atwebpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/better_floor169-1024x576.png)![](http://jessgames.atwebpages.com/wp-content/uploads/better_floor169.png)</figure></div></div> </div> </div></div>And also, just for you know, the game will be in angličtina, which means, in english language 🙂 How suprising, isnt it?
