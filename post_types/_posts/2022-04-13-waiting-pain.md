You ever heard of pain? Do U ever **feel pain**? Oh yes, you think you felt. **BUT** Its nothing in compare with pain of waiting to something you want. And I know what **you want**. You know what you want? Maybe less times the word ‚Äúyou‚Äù in this paragraph?

Maybe‚Ä¶ Great idea. But, **YOU WANT** to **PLAY** **KITCHEN RUSH**.

And I have **the best news** for you! Our second best game developer *Bonif√°c* achieve the **greatest move we ever done**: He downloaded UNITY, so we (hmmmm. no. not we, but him. him and Tomsha. They could do it, i cannot and Jojoo is the worst. He is only good in Clash Royale) can **start working** on the game.

See y¬¥all the next week, in the meantime‚Ä¶

I see ya on DISCORD üòÄ
