Our leader Bonifac has made his first huge mistake. Even though I was trying to do my best to stop him, he is the Leader.

Our game, once called Kitchen rush, was originally ment to be Memory rush. It has a reason: the game concept is about you, doing things before you forget them.

However, Jojoo in his weak moment decided it to be called Kitchen rush, becauseâ€¦. i dunno, its funny. And thats why its kitchen and not memory rush.

But for the consistency (pffff, i dont like this word, its bullshit â€“ you know, the bull had a big lunch and the shit comes out of his buttâ€¦ nature) it may be called Memory rush, i am sorry.

So if you are confused with suddenly disappearing the word kitchen in advance for memory, dont be.

If you find ANY kitchen rush on our website, be proud, cos you find a hole in the algorithm. (i DONT do the mistake of changing the name, bonifac decided, he must does his dirty work himself)

Adios felaz, see ya soooooooooooooooooooooooooooon
