Hola Hey!

I´m back joujoujou. You know what? The new version is comiiiing! &amp; you know why? Cause the end of school year is near.

In the new version, you can expect soo much more, eg **SCORE**, or even a **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">CUTSCENE</span>**. This is bullshitting, or is it? hmmm sus

However, we are lazy a after the school report, the game develop will probably stop. If YOU want us to continue creating this game, please let us know on [DISCORD](https://discord.com/invite/aJzZvYMPcN)!

I believe in you,  
PEACE ✌️
