Hallo, heute mÃ³chtet ich speak to you about the lifestory of Tomsha. He is cool, so read on!

Tomsha is white middle-class cis-male, who has really high-rated skills in design. His name may sound indic, but he has nothing in common with them, nor with Gipsys. That means, he hasnÂ´t got any hebrew gens (this is joke, lol â€“ i find it [here](https://www.petice.com/petice_proti_indickemu_pvodu_rom)).

He is soooooo talented. He can do everything, even with [MS Paint](https://ms-paint.en.softonic.com/). You can find out his work in our kitchen rush. It is outstanding, just look at a grass! This much effort for just this, is amazingly high.

I wanna make you pay for his work, but i dont believe you would. So instead, you can look on all his design work down bellow.

If you want to know more about Tomsha, maybe some personal information, write us on [discord](http://jessgames.atwebpages.com/about-us/) &amp; **i will make it**!

Cheeeeeeeerz bro

PS: dont listen to Jojoo, dont mind his posts, he is useless. Honestly, now Bonifac does all the work, Tomsha makes design, i write funny stuff here &amp; Jojoo does everything, but bad, slow, worse &amp; he doesnÂ´t deserve to pass this school year.
