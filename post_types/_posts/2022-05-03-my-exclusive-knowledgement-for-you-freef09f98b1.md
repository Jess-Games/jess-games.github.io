I,m on my way home, so i can talk to you about some nice shit. Its called the Story of K-Rush.

from the beginning, you are an old man (or woman, cis, trans, whatever you want, but you are old and dump) who is trying to just survive his daily rutine. You know the stuff: wake up, eat breakfast, take out the trash, cook lunch, have chat with friends, order dinner, watch tv, go to sleep.

All the boring things you dont really wanna do. Thats what you do in Kitchen rush (jkj Memory rush). But its interesting (hmmm no, but bonifac thinks so) because you have only limited time to do it. Preassure is what make you continue.
