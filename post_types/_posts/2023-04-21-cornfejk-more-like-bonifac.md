We are proud to announce a lot of games recently. It was epic time.

There are a lot of more games and projects, even from people we never expected to do anything (cough, cough, Jojoo).

And our good friend, Cornfejk, who should become a warior, epic fighter, member of the army. Even he did create something.

Or did he?

Wellllllllllll, he did write a storyline to his text-adventure.

However, thats about it. All the code Bonifac made. And the confetti did SetName. He owes them a lot of beer.

Just a little sneak-peak to our process.
