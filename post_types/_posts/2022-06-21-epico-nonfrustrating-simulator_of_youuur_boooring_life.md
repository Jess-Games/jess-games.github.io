IT´S <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color: #ffe2c7;">HERE</mark>. You Folks, have waited long time and got nothing. BUT NOW, everything is changing! The way how you look on your life is forever “**not the same**“.

Dont bullshit anybody, <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color: #f00808;">Bonifac </mark>is the only person who did it. Tomsha did everything in terms of design (which is really cool. its not consistent at all \*\*shit, it takes me almost ten minutes to remember the word <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color: #139cfb;">consistent </mark>– how bad i am right now?\*\*, but every single part is outstanding.). I am the minister of propaganda, so basically I have the power of bringing you the game (if we forget, that Bonifac holds the keys of this website), but the game doesnt &amp; didnt bother me. In fact, I am less capable of programming now, than before.

However, Jojoo is *the best* member of our team. He did the dabing to our game. I know, this kinda dabing is the <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color: #d30090;">WOOOOOOORST </mark>i,ve ever heard. But whatever, thats the only thing he did.

Thanks to everyone who helps &amp; supports us (j.k.j. [<mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color: #ffffff;">nobody</mark>](http://jessgames.atwebpages.com/download/)). Dont blame me for web design please…
