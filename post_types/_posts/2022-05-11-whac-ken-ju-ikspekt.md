In sm√≥l t√°jm v√Ω ryl√≠s ≈à≈Ø ver≈æn of the gejm. It wil b√Ω ryly gud i houp, bykous bonif√°c told m√Ω ded. Bat i dont nou if he is r√°jt, c√≥s h√Ω is p√Ωs of ≈°it es v√Ω √≥l √°r, hauevr h√≠ c√≥ld himself keptn‚Ä¶ his f√≥lt if it is not gud.

In small time we release new version of the game. It will be really good I hope, because Bonifac told me that. But I dont know if he is right, cause he is peace of shit as we all are, however he called himself captain‚Ä¶ His fault if it is not good.

I almost forgot! Jojoo jkj Koz√ΩPrdel jkj Piece\_of\_crap is totaly useless. Right now, we are on INF lesson, I am doing this post, Tomsha is doing map of the Kitchen Rush, Bonifac is learning about databases and he is helping Tomsha. BUT Jojoo learns History jkj Geschichte. He is not bad (as we all arent), but he is not fully focusing on the game (as we all arent). That implicates we are just lazy frogs.
