Hi there, hello! I am the ADstronaut, and I am here in ADspace, to talk to you about how i stole this line from [Ryan George](https://itsryangeorge.com/) (he is pretty good, look him up) and about our they-call-us-their-friends-so-i-guess-they-are-our-friends.

They work in the same department as us â€“ to-school-going-nerds. So we are supposed to give them a little promo. I guess I did that at page About us, so if you are interested in [bad apocalyptic game](http://pepe-dungeon.infinityfreeapp.com/), go check it out (but rather go to About us page, there is a good description of what they are to us).

Aaaah, I want to be paid for this.
